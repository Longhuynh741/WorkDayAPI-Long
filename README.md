# WorkDayAPI-Long





This Project is aimed towards building upon Javascript and JQuery foundations. The completion of this project will require prior knowledge of several Javascript principles including: Arrays, for loops, if/else statements, and variable creations. Newer concepts such as JQuery will be heavily focused as well. You will be tasked with making an WorkDay Planner. The generator must be able to follow these criteria:

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

# Installation

You will start this project from a given source code. You are given a demo/preview of the expected results in your assets folder. Using your code editor, you will create the html files, css files, java script files, and any other files you feel are relevant. This project will also use BootStrap as an aide so be sure to include the CDN into your project.

# Usage

Use VSS code editor to make changes where neccessary. For this project, be sure to reference the demo to make sure you are on the right track. Make sure the code functions not only on your local branch, but on the published Github website as well.

# Credits

I do not own the original source code which this project is based on. It was provided to me through GA-Tech Bootcamp. Any adjustments I made to the original source code was of my own with guidance and instructions from the bootcamp instructors and classmates.
